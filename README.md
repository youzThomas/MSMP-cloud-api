# MSMP-cloud-api

This repository contains the Web API component of the [Monitoring System for Massive PC (MSMP)](https://github.com/youzThomas/MonitoringSystemForMassivePC) â€” a system designed to control access to shared computers based on timed reservations. MSMP ensures that each device can only be accessed by authorized users during valid reservation periods, helping prevent misuse and overtime occupancy in environments such as labs, classrooms, or public workstations.

This API, built with Flask, provides endpoints to submit, store, and retrieve reservation data, enabling each client device to check its usage status and enforce locking/unlocking accordingly. It is lightweight and designed for smooth deployment on platforms like Render.

**Note:** This project is currently in a developmental stage and uses in-memory data storage. This means that all reservation data will be lost when the application is restarted. This is suitable for development and testing, but not for a production environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/youzThomas/MSMP-cloud-api.git
    cd MSMP-cloud-api
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

You can run the application using either the Flask development server or a Gunicorn server.

-   **Using Flask's development server:**

    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

    The API will then be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

-   **Using Gunicorn:**

    ```sh
    gunicorn app:app
    ```

    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoints

The API provides two endpoints for managing device reservations.

### Set Reservation

-   **Endpoint:** `/set-reservation`
-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Description:** Creates or updates a reservation for a device.
-   **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
        "device_id": "some_unique_device_id",
        "start_time": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
        "end_time": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
        "credential": "user_credential_string"
    }
    ```

-   **Success Response:**

    -   **Code:** `200 OK`
    -   **Content:**

        ```json
        {
            "status": "saved"
        }
        ```

-   **Error Response:**

    -   **Code:** `400 Bad Request`
    -   **Content:**

        ```json
        {
            "error": "device_id required"
        }
        ```

### Get Reservation

-   **Endpoint:** `/get-reservation`
-   **Method:** `GET`
-   **Description:** Retrieves the reservation details for a specific device.
-   **Query Parameters:**
    -   `device_id`: The ID of the device to retrieve the reservation for.
-   **Example Request:**

    ```
    GET /get-reservation?device_id=some_unique_device_id
    ```

-   **Success Response:**

    -   **Code:** `200 OK`
    -   **Content:**

        ```json
        {
            "start_time": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
            "end_time": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
            "credential": "user_credential_string"
        }
        ```

-   **Error Response:**

    -   **Code:** `404 Not Found`
    -   **Content:**

        ```json
        {
            "error": "not found"
        }
        ```

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Render. The `render.yaml` file in the root of the repository defines the service. You can deploy this application by creating a new Web Service on Render and pointing it to your fork of this repository.
